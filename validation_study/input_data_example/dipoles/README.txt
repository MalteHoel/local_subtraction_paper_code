We assume the files do contain the data in the following format.

Each row corresponds to a dipole. A dipole is given by a position x = (x1, x2, x3) and a moment M = (M1, M2, M3). Each row of a dipole file is now supposed to contain six entries, which are interpeted as

x1 x2 x3 M1 M2 M3

The number of rows in each file is then the number of dipoles contained in the file.
