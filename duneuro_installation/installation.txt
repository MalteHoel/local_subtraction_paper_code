0) If you are using Windows: Install WSL

- There are multiple ways to install a WSL distribution. We recommend installing an 
  Ubuntu distribution. If you have a tarball of a distribution, install it via
	wsl --import <NAME> <INSTALLATIONLOCATION> <TARBALLFILENAME>

1) Install dependencies

sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install cmake
sudo apt install git
sudo apt install libeigen3-dev
sudo apt install libpython3-dev
sudo apt install libsuitesparse-dev
sudo apt install gfortran
sudo apt install libtbb-dev
sudo apt install libsuperlu-dev
sudo apt install g++-9

For visualization purposes, we also recommend installing ParaView via

sudo apt install paraview

2) Clone the library

- First, make the clone script executable via
        chmod +x clone_duneuro.sh
- Run the clone script via
        ./clone_duneuro

3) Update config_release.opts

- set SIMBIOSPHERE_ROOT to the corresponding directory. The simbiosphere repository was cloned in step 2).

4) Compile the library

- From the folder where you ran the clone script, run
	dune-common/bin/dunecontrol --opts=config_release.opts --builddir=`pwd`/build-release all
  This will start the compilation. Once this finishes successfully, the folder build-release
  will contain all compiled libraries.

5) Test your installation

- After a successful compilation, two binaries, called "duneuro_eeg_forward" and
 "duneuro_meg_forward_test", have been created. Navigate to the corresponding 
  directories 
	.../build-release/duneuro_eeg_forward_test/src
  and
	.../build-release/duneuro_meg_forward_test/src  	
  and run these executables to test if everything works as expected.
